{"name":"Java Marine API","tagline":"NMEA 0183 library for Java","body":"## About \r\n\r\nJava Marine API is an [NMEA 0183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) parser library for Java. The goal of this project is to enable easy access to data provided by various electronic marine devices such as GPS, sonar or weather instruments.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Reads NMEA sentences from any source that is accessed with input stream, eg. serial port, file, TCP/IP socket etc.\r\n* Output is also supported by allowing the modification of sentence contents with data formatting and validation.\r\n* The plain ASCII data is converted to event/listener model with interfaces and parser implementations for selected sentences.\r\n* Custom parsers may also be integrated by extending the provided base classes.\r\n\r\nCurrently the following sentences are supported:\r\n\r\n    BOD - Bearing from origin to destination\r\n    DBT - Water depth below transducer in meters, feet and fathoms.\r\n    DPT - Water depth in meters with offset to transducer.\r\n    GGA - GPS fix data\r\n    GLL - Current geographic position and time\r\n    GSA - Precision of GPS fix\r\n    GSV - Detailed GPS satellite data\r\n    HDG - Heading with magnetic deviation and variation\r\n    HDM - Magnetic heading in degrees\r\n    HDT - True heading in degrees\r\n    MTA - Air temperature in degrees Celcius\r\n    MTW - Water temperature in degrees Celcius\r\n    MWV - Wind speed and angle\r\n    RMB - Recommended minimum navigation information \"type B\"\r\n    RMC - Recommended minimum navigation information \"type C\"\r\n    RTE - GPS route data with list of waypoints\r\n    VHW - Water speed and heading\r\n    VTG - Course and speed over ground\r\n    WPL - Destination waypoint location and ID\r\n    ZDA - UTC time and date with local time offset\r\n\r\n## Sourceforge\r\n\r\nProject was originally published in Sourceforge.net, hence the net.sf.. package naming. Project page, website, javadocs and downloads are still there, but the old SVN repository is no longer updated.\r\n\r\n* [Project page](http://sf.net/projects/marineapi/)\r\n* [Website](http://marineapi.sf.net/)\r\n* [Downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/marineapi/files/Releases/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
