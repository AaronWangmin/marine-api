Pre-alpha preview release, not to be used in production. Major API changes may
be introduced in future versions. Released on 2011-07-12.

CHANGES

 * SentenceFactory; DPT parser was not automatically registered, fixed.
  
 * Parsing methods in SentenceId now validates the given String before parsing
   the id.
   
 * Double values are now rounded to certain decimal precision by setters. Also,
   course and bearing values are padded with leading zeros.
 
 * SentenceReader; reader now invokes SentenceLister.readingPaused() when data
   flow is paused, but reader is still running. The readingStopped() is now
   called only when reader has permanently stopped. Pause timeout can be set 
   using the SentenceReader.setPauseTimeout() method.
   
 * SentenceValidator; fixed regular expressions to match all printable ASCII
   characters. Added also '!' as acceptable begin character.
   
 * TalkerId; Added more complete list of talker ids.
 
 * SentenceEvent; creation time stamp is now returned as plain long value.
 
 * Date; constructor was setting month off by one, fixed.
  
NEW FEATURES
 
 * Added method for unregistering parsers in SentenceFactory.
 
 * Added TPVProvider that reports time, position, altitude, velocity and course
   from GPS in a single event. Report is constructed by capturing the required
   data from several sentences. This is also the initial implementation and
   preview of high level APIs that focus on actual data instead of sentences.
   
 * SentenceParser; added methods for setting double and integer values with
   leading zeros. Double values can also be rounded to certain precision.
   
 * SentenceListener; added readingPaused() notification.
 
 * Sentence; added convenience methods isValid() and isProprietary().
 
KNOWN ISSUES
  
 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.
