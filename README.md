Java Marine API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ktuukkan/marine-api.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ktuukkan/marine-api)
---------------

Java Marine API is an [NMEA 0183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) parser library for Java. See project [webpage](http://ktuukkan.github.io/marine-api/) for more info and documentation.

Also, basic support for decoding [AIS messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System) is under development and included in latest snapshots for preview. As this is quite a large new feature, all feedback and contribution is much appreciated!

**Snapshots**

Maven snapshots are deployed to [Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/) every now and then. Notice that although they should be mostly stable, they are still work-in-progress.

Project was originally published in Sourceforge.net, hence the net.sf package naming.
