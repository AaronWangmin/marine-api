Second preview release, not to be used in production. Major API changes may be
introduced in future versions. Released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

CHANGES

 * SentenceReader does not start automatically anymore. Use start() and stop()
   methods to control reader.
 * Removed NMEA class; moved checksum calculation to class Checksum and sentence
   validation to class SentenceValidator.
 * PositionParser is no longer public (unlikely to have any use)
 * GpsFixQuality enum; added RTK, FRTK, ESTIMATED, MANUAL and SIMULATED.
 * DataStatus enum; renamed VALID/INVALID to ACTIVE/VOID (corresponds the actual
   char values 'A' and 'V').
 * Added toString() to Position class.
 * Various small improvements and bug fixes
  
NEW FEATURES

 * SentenceReader; SentenceListeners can be registered for specific sentence
   type. Added setter for changing the input stream.
 * Sentence interface; Added getFieldCount() method.
 * RTESentence interface; Added addWaypointId() method.
 * Date class for handling date information
 * ZDASentence; Added toDate() method.

KNOWN ISSUES
  
 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.
 * In practice, it is not possible to extend SentenceParser class and create
   custom parsers due to internal checking of supported Sentence types.
