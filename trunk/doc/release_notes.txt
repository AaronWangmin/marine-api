Version 0.2 (pre-alpha)
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/marineapi/>
Copyright (C) 2010 Kimmo Tuukkanen <ktuukkan@users.sourceforge.net>

Second preview release, released on 2010-11-30. Not to be used in production,
major changes in the API may occur in later versions.

CHANGES 

 * Checksum class for calculating sentence checksums (extracted from NMEA.java)
 * SentenceValidator class for validating sentences (extracted from NMEA.java)
 * Removed NMEA.java as obsolete
 * PositionParser is no longer public (unlikely to have any use)
 * Various small improvements and fixes
 * SentenceReader does automatically start anymore. Instead, start() and stop()
   methods are used to control reading.
 
NEW FEATURES

 * SentenceReader; SentenceListeners can be registered for specific sentence
   type, new InputStream may be set afterwards.
 * Sentence interface; Added getFieldCount() method.
 * RTESentence interface; Added addWaypointId() method.
 * Date class for handling date information
 * ZDASentence; Added toDate() method.

KNOWN ISSUES
  
 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.
 * In practice it is not possible to extend SentenceParser class and create
   custom parsers due to internal checking of supported Sentence types.
