Third preview release, not to be used in production. Major API changes may be
introduced in future versions. Released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

CHANGES

 * Refactored and moved sentence and talker id parsing to correspondign enums.
 
 * Refactored satellite data parsing in GSA parser. Before the values were
   parsed once and cached, which resulted in inconsistency if setters had been
   used. Now, all values are parsed for each getter call.
      
 * SentenceParser no longer uses SentenceId enum to identify different sentence
   types. Plain Strings are used instead, e.g. "GGA" or "GLL", which enables
   extending the SentenceParser and thus creating custom parsers for unsupported
   sentence types.
   
 * Various small improvements and bug fixes.
  
NEW FEATURES

* 

KNOWN ISSUES
  
 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.
