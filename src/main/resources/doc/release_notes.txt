Java Marine API - RELEASE NOTES
Version @VERSION@ (b@BUILD_ID@)
<http://ktuukkan.github.io/marine-api/>

This is a pre-alpha release, major API changes may be introduced in future
versions. Released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

CHANGES

 * SentenceReader; refactored to better support diffrent data sources, including
   some performance tweaks (should take less CPU now).

 * SentenceValidator; performance tweaks in regular expressions.

 * TPVProvider and related classes renamed to PositionProvider.

 * GSASentence; getSatellitesIds() renamed to getSatelliteIds().

 * Sentence; removed unused constant ADDRESS_FIELD.

 * Date, Time; fractions of second are now handled. Moved common date/time
   parsing and formatting in Date and Time classes. Fixed a bug in Time.toDate()
   causing incorrect hour of day.

 * GLL, GGA, RMC and ZDA parsers; fractions of second are now parsed and
   formatted in timestamp fields. When setting/formatting values, three decimals
   is used regardless of given precision (padded with zeros as needed).

 * Position; refactored and removed explicit hemisphere indicators. Hemispheres
   are now handled more automatically and indicated by positive and negative
   values of latitude and longitude. Affected classes are PositionParser,
   GGAParser, GLLParser, RMAParser, RMCParser, WPLParser and Waypoint.

NEW FEATURES

 * UDP/DatagramSocket support in SentenceReader.

 * SatelliteInfoProvider; reports all GPS satellite information in single event.

 * SentenceParser; reset() and setFieldCount(int) methods for resetting and
   adjusting the number of data fields.

 * PositionParser; parsePosition(Position) and insertPosition(Position) methods.

 * Date, Time; added support for time zones and ISO 8601 formatting.

 * ZDASentence; setTimeAndLocalZone(Time t) for setting time and offset.

 * Support for XDR sentences; transducer measurements.

KNOWN ISSUES

 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.

 * Proprietary sentences that have sentence ID different to five characters are
   not supported.

 * All AIS sentences may not be supported as TalkerId has only AI, AB and BS.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 * Thanks to Amanda Fenech (marssa.org) for migrating the project to Maven
   layout and initial release in repository (v0.5.1).

 * Thanks to Ludovic Drouineau for UDP implementation of SentenceReader.

 * Thanks to Robert Huitema (www.42.co.nz) and Vladimir Loginov for performance
   tweaks. Robert also provided the base work for XDR parser.
